Step 1: Push your code to GitHub

Create a GitHub repository:

Go to github.com

Click New repository

Give it a name and make it public (so your sir can access)

On your local project folder (VS Code terminal):

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
git push -u origin main


Replace username and repo-name with your GitHub info.

✅ Now your code is on GitHub.

Step 2: Deploy online

Here are easy hosting options:

A) GitHub Pages (for HTML/CSS/JS or simple React sites)

Go to your repository on GitHub

Click Settings → Pages

Source → Branch → main → folder → /root

Click Save

GitHub will give you a URL like:

https://username.github.io/repo-name/


✅ Send this URL to your sir. He can access it anytime.

B) Netlify (for React, Vite, Node frontend projects)

Go to netlify.com
 and sign in with GitHub

Click New Site → Import from GitHub

Select your repository

For React/Vite:

Build command: npm run build

Publish directory: build (React) or dist (Vite)

Click Deploy

You get a link like:

https://yourproject.netlify.app


✅ Now your sir can see the site live anytime.

C) Render / Railway (for Node.js or Python backends)

If your project needs a server (Node/Express / Flask / Django):

Sign up on Render
 or Railway

Connect your GitHub repo

Deploy → it will give a public URL

Your sir can access it anytime.

💡 Tip: If it’s just a static frontend project (HTML/CSS/JS), GitHub Pages is easiest.
If it has a backend or React build, Netlify is simpler.
